# Skald-Go Project Summary

## What We've Accomplished

1. **Fixed Library Path Issues**
   - Created wrapper scripts (`run-server.sh` and `run-client.sh`) that properly set the `LD_LIBRARY_PATH` environment variable
   - Ensured the application can find the required shared libraries at runtime

2. **Built a Working Application**
   - Successfully built the server and client components
   - Verified that the server runs correctly and responds to client commands
   - Tested the keyboard interactions for controlling the transcription process

3. **Created a Distribution Package**
   - Developed a `package.sh` script that creates a self-contained distribution package
   - The package includes all binaries, libraries, and configuration files
   - Added systemd service files for easy installation as a system service

4. **Updated Documentation**
   - Enhanced the README with clear instructions for running the application
   - Added troubleshooting information for common issues
   - Included detailed instructions for using the wrapper scripts and systemd service

## Challenges Overcome

1. **Library Linking Issues**
   - Addressed challenges with linking the whisper.cpp library
   - Created a solution using wrapper scripts to set the correct library paths
   - Attempted static linking but found that shared libraries with wrapper scripts provided a more reliable solution

2. **Path Management**
   - Ensured all scripts use absolute paths to avoid issues with relative paths
   - Created a consistent approach to path management across all scripts

3. **Distribution Packaging**
   - Developed a comprehensive packaging solution that includes all necessary components
   - Made the package easy to install and use on different systems

## Future Recommendations

1. **Model Management**
   - Consider adding a script to download the whisper models automatically
   - This would make the initial setup even easier for users

2. **Static Binary Approach**
   - If a fully static binary is still desired, you might need to modify the whisper.cpp build process
   - This would require deeper changes to the whisper.cpp library to better support static linking

3. **Testing on Different Platforms**
   - Test the package on different Linux distributions to ensure compatibility
   - Consider creating platform-specific packages (e.g., .deb for Debian/Ubuntu, .rpm for Fedora/RHEL)

4. **User Interface Improvements**
   - Consider adding a simple GUI or system tray icon for easier control
   - Implement keyboard shortcuts at the system level for starting/stopping transcription

5. **Performance Optimization**
   - Profile the application to identify any performance bottlenecks
   - Consider implementing batch processing for longer transcriptions

## Final Thoughts

The Skald-Go application is now ready for use. The shared library approach with wrapper scripts provides a good balance between ease of use and flexibility. The package script makes it easy to distribute the application to other users.

The application successfully achieves its goal of providing a lightweight, privacy-focused speech-to-text tool that runs in the background. The keyboard interactions and client-server architecture make it easy to control the transcription process.

By implementing some of the recommendations above, the application could be further improved to provide an even better user experience. Additionally, gathering user feedback will help identify areas for improvement.
